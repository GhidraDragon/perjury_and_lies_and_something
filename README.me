I'm not a fraudulent MIT bitch at all.

Yale Admissions officers, made irrelevant by even DeepSeek R1,called me "geeky but intellectually omnivorous"

I spent a lot of time swearing under oath, yet cannot change a fucking Twitter description.

My thesis, which went unnoticed by Twitch and the dumbest distribution network in the world, attempted to use the error line regex to explain WTF SyntaxError was, to the most overrated piece of shit in the world.

I lied in my only Linkedin contribution, about helping secure passwords, when not only did you lie about helping secure passwords, you removed the tought process of anyone reading about whether it was even technically feasible, by Twitch, in the most disgusting embarassing deceptive way. Same level but worse than key

Didn't I post publicly on Linkedin I'd try to use her as an asset, an intelligence asset, then one of her screenshots included in the Exhibits, was dated around then (she was lookin' at the vacation photos), and another Exhibit depicts her being passed screenshots of my Twitter by the Twitch Community, and I feel sooooo left out!!!! Oh no!!!! I'm not invited to Discord groups filled with !!!! Oh no!!!!!
