I'm not a fraudulent MIT bitch at all.

Yale Admissions officers, made irrelevant by even DeepSeek R1,called me "geeky but intellectually omnivorous"

I spent a lot of time swearing under oath, yet cannot change a fucking Twitter description.

My thesis, which went unnoticed by Twitch and the dumbest distribution network in the world, attempted to use the error line regex to explain WTF SyntaxError was, to the most overrated piece of shit in the world.

I lied in my only Linkedin contribution, about helping secure passwords, when not only did you lie about helping secure passwords, you removed the tought process of anyone reading about whether it was even technically feasible, by Twitch, in the most disgusting embarassing deceptive way. Same level but worse than key
