If she worked at Twitch, knew everything I said about it, read those, said that, then went how long on X this last time? etc.. more of the same.. WHAT could she possibly been in it for??? If she really got into MIT she should have did the RO thing, and certainly have blocked me immediately!!! What the fuck did you think you would accomplish for anyone?

Did you think I would like get a job at Google's 2.0 Pro Experimental then donate to you while watching you play games? They already banned me from Colab, then later changing the systems prompt, while reducing token length, in GenAI builder. Then when you search, you never know! etc.



I'm not a fraudulent MIT bitch at all.

Yale Admissions officers, made irrelevant by even DeepSeek R1,called me "geeky but intellectually omnivorous"

I spent a lot of time swearing under oath, yet cannot change a fucking Twitter description.

My thesis, which went unnoticed by Twitch and the dumbest distribution network in the world, attempted to use the error line regex to explain WTF SyntaxError was, to the most overrated piece of shit in the world.

I lied in my only Linkedin contribution, about helping secure passwords, when not only did you lie about helping secure passwords, you removed the tought process of anyone reading about whether it was even technically feasible, by Twitch, in the most disgusting embarassing deceptive way. Same level but worse than key

Didn't I post publicly on Linkedin I'd try to use her as an asset, an intelligence asset, then one of her screenshots included in the Exhibits, was dated around then (she was lookin' at the vacation photos), and another Exhibit depicts her being passed screenshots of my Twitter by the Twitch Community, and I feel sooooo left out!!!! Oh no!!!! I'm not invited to Discord groups filled with !!!! Oh no!!!!!

I wonder if after cutting off the heads of Twitch, and DMH, Donald would believe that eggplant_emoji fulfilled at his part of Donald's MAGA or whatever the fuck Billy

I mean Twitch is that, but Megan, after probably instructing a dumbass to lie, who thought everything was 'her rights' such as not receving the CH-120 intentionally, after those read receipts emailed to her earlier! not sure if blocked as a .swift file! that like... I'd have anything to comment 

On Megan claiming that Twitch already "suffered" through having to "increase their physical defense budget" (kind of like Woburn District Court saying I shouldn't have to worry about it, then callin' me in occasionally) but the opposite, cuz who TF would.

Anyways, I didn't know you had to go through the ppl who served documents, so I went there once and talked to the guy in charge of probation!!

Did I contact that bitch ? at all no.. 

Anyways, Megan already claimed that GCHQ threw a lol lol decoy into Mark Leon at viewbots.com
