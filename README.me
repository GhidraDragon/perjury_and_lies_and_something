OH RIGHT, this part may be important I forgot. My intelligence report on erosolar is that's blonde, and Megan https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/rules/Rules-of-Professional-Conduct.pdf

You think I'm not parsing that??

Anyways if this is just one tiny tiny example (and that's not the same YouTube I saw yesterday with all the streamers) https://erosolar.info/

For criminals only who have way too much magnamimosity to waste their efforts on Megan ( my view is that it's not lawful to shoot Megan under 2A rights) go for it!

----

If she worked at Twitch, knew everything I said about it, read those, said that, then went how long on X this last time? etc.. more of the same.. WHAT could she possibly been in it for??? If she really got into MIT she should have did the RO thing, and certainly have blocked me immediately!!! What the fuck did you think you would accomplish for anyone?

Did you think I would like get a job at Google's 2.0 Pro Experimental then donate to you while watching you play games? They already banned me from Colab, then later changing the systems prompt, while reducing token length, in GenAI builder. Then when you search, you never know! etc.



I'm not a fraudulent MIT bitch at all.

Yale Admissions officers, made irrelevant by even DeepSeek R1,called me "geeky but intellectually omnivorous"

I spent a lot of time swearing under oath, yet cannot change a fucking Twitter description.

My thesis, which went unnoticed by Twitch and the dumbest distribution network in the world, attempted to use the error line regex to explain WTF SyntaxError was, to the most overrated piece of shit in the world.

I lied in my only Linkedin contribution, about helping secure passwords, when not only did you lie about helping secure passwords, you removed the tought process of anyone reading about whether it was even technically feasible, by Twitch, in the most disgusting embarassing deceptive way. Same level but worse than key

Didn't I post publicly on Linkedin I'd try to use her as an asset, an intelligence asset, then one of her screenshots included in the Exhibits, was dated around then (she was lookin' at the vacation photos), and another Exhibit depicts her being passed screenshots of my Twitter by the Twitch Community, and I feel sooooo left out!!!! Oh no!!!! I'm not invited to Discord groups filled with !!!! Oh no!!!!!

I wonder if after cutting off the heads of Twitch, and DMH, Donald would believe that eggplant_emoji fulfilled at his part of Donald's MAGA or whatever the fuck Billy


----

I mean Twitch is that, but Megan, after probably instructing a dumbass to lie, who thought everything was 'her rights' such as not receving the CH-120 intentionally, after those read receipts emailed to her earlier! not sure if blocked as a .swift file! that like... I'd have anything to comment 

On Megan claiming that Twitch already "suffered" through having to "increase their physical defense budget" (kind of like Woburn District Court saying I shouldn't have to worry about it, then callin' me in occasionally) but the opposite, cuz who TF would.

Anyways, I didn't know you had to go through the ppl who served documents, so I went there once and talked to the guy in charge of probation!!

Did I contact that bitch ? at all no.. 

Anyways, Megan already claimed that GCHQ threw a lol lol decoy into Mark Leon at viewbots.com

HEY head of probation! I don't ever claim to follow any laws nor recognize them in any way, but I only claim that you cannot win in court, except once? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t1Oecmi0GM&t=2s

Did you enjoy this SMS dump? I'm sorry that was a violation of recording in court!!!

Speaking of the MA LSAT!!! https://www.fakeopenai.co/lsat

extremely high quality (for real, read the Eternal family of exploits which utilized a pipe, however even EternalBlue was very similar to the rest of the family, the ones who utilized a pipe) starter & guide for SMBv2

If you're a recruiter who believes in the quality of MIT undergraduate admissions or erosolar's resume, then asking me to list "each and every skill" for "each project" I've ever done, tell me your servers, or this takes longer to get to non-servers, but...

UNLESS there's imessage, or Workspace, or Microsoft Word, commonly used by APTs around the world; I watched a YouTube video about a nice Pakistani group yeterday! Why not pass along the recruiting information!!!!

this is the quality of MIT admissions, go hire erosolar!

Hi Bo,
Thank you for your interest in applying to MIT.

We’ve outlined the major components of the application below:

MIT First-Year Application Form: Submission of the application requires a $75 fee. If paying the fee presents a hardship for you and your family, you may request a fee waiver in the “Fee Waiver” section of the application.
Deadlines: For Early Action, we must receive your application with all supporting documents by November 1. For Regular Action, we must receive your application with all supporting documents by January 6.
Recommendations: MIT requires two letters of recommendation from teachers. We recommend one evaluation from a math/science teacher, and one from a humanities, social science, or language teacher. Your school counselor (or equivalent) should submit the Secondary School Report, along with your transcript.
Standardized tests: We require the SAT or the ACT for both prospective first-year and transfer students.
For non-native English speakers, we strongly recommend providing the results of an English proficiency exam if you have been using English for fewer than 5 years or do not speak English at home or in school, so that we may consider that information alongside the rest of your application. In addition to the TOEFL, we now accept the Duolingo English Test, IELTS, PTE Academic, and Cambridge English Qualifications (C1 Advanced or C2 Proficiency).
High School and College Transcripts: We require transcripts from each high school and college attended. Our preference is for counselors to use our application portal to submit transcripts. However, they do have the option to submit via Naviance, SCOIR, or other methods.
For more details, please visit the first-year admissions section of our website. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Best,
Calli
MIT Admissions

Hello not sure if you may have suspected more than 2.5 years of undergrad completed, however I specifically asked for advice on a rejection not a disqualify, so I’ll apply to receive a rejection.

https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/transfer-i-have-completed-more-than-2-5-years-of-college-am-i-still-eligible-to-apply/

Can I apply if I’ve completed more than 2.5 years of college?
Students who at the time of entry to MIT will have completed more than two and a half years (i.e., five terms) of college may not be eligible because of our residency requirements.

If you have been enrolled in college part-time, you should calculate your full-time term equivalency in order to estimate your eligibility. Keep in mind that eligibility will be assessed by the Admissions Committee in the application review process.

We count every full semester of study regardless of study area or intended program of study at MIT. If a summer semester is considered a semester at your institution, we will consider it a semester. We do not include any college completed while still a high school student.
